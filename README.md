# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ…

This is the repository for my Advent of Code 2023 project.

## Introduction

Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place from December 1st to 25th. Each day, a new programming problem is released to test your skills. This repository contains my solutions for the 2023 event.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders numbered from `day1` to `day25` and for `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Each file contains my solution for that specific part of the day's problem.

## How to Use

To run a solution, navigate to the corresponding day and puzzle's folder and run the main file. For example, to run the solution for puzzle 1 of day 1, I would run `go run day1/main.go`.

## Contact

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open an issue on this repository.

Happy coding!
